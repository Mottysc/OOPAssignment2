Building from the [First](https://github.com/Mottysc/OOPAssignment1) Object Oriented Programming assignment, this assignment extends the Zork-style game by introducing a more structured approach to commands and including more complex puzzles.

This project places a stronger emphasis on class hierarchies, abstraction, parsing user input, and managing game state.
